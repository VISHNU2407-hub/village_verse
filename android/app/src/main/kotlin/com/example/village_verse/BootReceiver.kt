/**
 * Receives system broadcasts after device boot and app update to
 * automatically restart [PowerButtonSosService] so the stealth SOS
 * power-button trigger is active without requiring the user to
 * manually open the app.
 *
 * Broadcasts handled:
 * - [Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED]        — Device fully booted and user unlocked
 * - [Intent.ACTION_LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED] — Device booted but user locked (API 27+ only, API < 31)
 * - [Intent.ACTION_MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED]   — App was updated via Play Store / sideload
 *
 * Android 12+ foreground-service restriction note:
 * Both BOOT_COMPLETED and MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED are explicitly exempt from
 * the background-start restrictions that apply to most other broadcasts.
 * Starting a foreground service from LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED is NOT exempt
 * on API 31+, so the service is only started from that broadcast on API < 31.
